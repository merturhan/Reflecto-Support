# Privacy Policy for Reflecto

**Last updated:** June 9, 2025

## Introduction

At Reflecto, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains that we do not collect, use, or store any personal information through our Apple Watch app.

## Information We Don't Collect

Reflecto is designed with privacy in mind. We want to be clear that:

- We do not collect any personal information
- We do not track your location
- We do not store any usage data
- We do not use analytics tools
- We do not use any third-party services that collect data
- We do not have any servers that store information
- We do not create user profiles
- We do not share any information with third parties

## App Functionality

Reflecto operates entirely on your Apple Watch, using only the device's built-in features to enhance visibility during your activities. All operations are performed locally on your device.

## Changes to Your Apple Watch Settings

The only interaction our app has with your device is:
- Accessing the display brightness controls when activated
- Using the flashlight feature when activated

These functions are performed entirely on your device and no information about their usage is collected or transmitted.

## Changes to This Policy

If we decide to collect any information in the future (which we don't plan to), we will update this Privacy Policy and notify users through an app update.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any personal information, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. You can install or uninstall the app at any time without any data implications.
